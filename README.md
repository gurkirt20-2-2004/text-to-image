This project showcases cutting-edge text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion, transforming natural language prompts into high-quality, realistic images. Built with PyTorch and Hugging Face Diffusers, it leverages the power of deep generative models to bridge the gap between creativity and automation.

Beyond basic generation, this project implements fine-tuning on custom text-image datasets, allowing the model to adapt to specific domains or artistic styles, significantly enhancing output quality and prompt relevance.

To monitor and guide improvements, the project includes evaluation simulations using FID (Fr√©chet Inception Distance), Inception Score (IS), and Precision/Recall metrics, ensuring systematic tracking of model performance across training and fine-tuning stages.

Whether for art generation, content creation, or research experimentation, this project is a practical and modular foundation for exploring AI-driven creativity using Stable Diffusion.
